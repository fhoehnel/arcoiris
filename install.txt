arcoiris blog installation instructions
=======================================

arcoiris blog is a standard Java web application that can be deployed
in any servlet container/Java application server running Java 1.5 or higher.

Step 1: UTF-8 enable the servlet container
------------------------------------------

Configure the servlet container to use the UTF-8 character encoding for decoding
URLs.
If your servlet container is tomcat, you have to edit the conf/server.xml file and add
the attribute 
URIEncoding="UTF-8"
to the HTTP connector.
The Connector definition should look like this:

<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="20000" URIEncoding="UTF-8" redirectPort="8443" />

If you have an apache server in front of the tomcat server, you have to add the 
URIEncoding attribute to the AJP connector too:

<Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" URIEncoding="UTF-8"/>

If you are using the SSL connector you have to add the URIEncoding attribute
to the SSL connector definition.

It might be a good idea to set the default file encoding for the Java VM
in catalina.bat/catalina.sh to UTF-8 by adding the following CATALINA_OPTS
  
  -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8

If you are using a different servlet engine than tomcat, read the corresponding documentation
to find out how to configure the UTF-8 character encoding for the server.

Step 2:
-------

Unzip the arcoiris-blog-xxx.zip archive to a new directory.

Step 3:
-------

Deploy the webfilesys webapp contained in the arcoiris-blog.war installation package
to the servlet container/application server following the instructions in the
admin documentation of the servlet container/application server.

The war package of the arcoiris blog webapp must be expanded on the application server
during deployment. arcoiris blog cannot be run directly from the unexploded .war file.
In tomcat, for example, the unpackWARs="true" attribute of the Host element
in the server.xml configuration file tells the server to unpack newly deployed
war archives (which is the default setting).

Step 4:
-------

After deployment start the web application 
(if not started automatically by the servlet container).

Now you can access the arcoiris blog application via the URL

http(s)://<server-dns-name>:<server-port>/<arcoiris-context-root>

with <arcoiris-context-root> is the context root of the webapp specified at deployment time.

Example:

http://www.webfilesys.de:8080/arcoiris

The default admin account is
  userid: admin
  password: topsecret
  
Don't forget to change the admin password via the user administration GUI.

To prevent OutOfMemory errors while processing large uploaded picture files it is recommended to
increase the maximum memory size allowed to get allocated by the Java VM.
For tomcat you can do this by inserting the following line near the top
of the catalina.bat (catalina.sh) file:

SET JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx512m

This allows the Java VM to allocate 512 MBytes of memory.

See the readme.html file for more information on how to configure WebFileSys.
